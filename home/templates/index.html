        <h2>Why Donate Blood?</h2>
        <h4>Safe blood saves lives and improves health.<br>
         Blood transfusion is needed for:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;<br></li>
          
          <li>Children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;<br>
          people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters;<li></li> <br>
          <li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.</ul>
          <br><br>
          <li>It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.<li><br><br>

          There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.<br><br>

          Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</h4>
